# Chrome Extension for OpenAI summaries

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a Chrome extension that the user can get OpenAI to summarise a text selection. The popup window displays the list of summaries that the user had selected.

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

To install the required dependencies

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Go to your Chrome browser extensions settings, ensure you are in developer mode and click on `Load unpacked`. From there choose the `dist` folder that was built with this command to run the extension.

### `npm run watch`

If you have loaded your extension to the Chrome browser, you can continue development and click on the refresh button in the extension settings to see changes made.
